LeaveFlow – Full Stack Leave Management System
🧾 Overview

LeaveFlow is a full-stack role-based Leave Management System designed to streamline employee leave requests and approvals.

The system supports Admin, Manager, and Employee roles, each with controlled access using JWT authentication and role-based authorization middleware.

This project demonstrates modern full-stack development using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and structured Git workflow.

🚀 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd leaveflow
2️⃣ Backend Setup
cd server
npm install

Create .env file inside server/:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

Run backend:

npm run dev

Server runs on:

http://localhost:5000
3️⃣ Frontend Setup
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

Frontend runs on:

http://localhost:5173
🌐 API Base URL Configuration

Frontend Axios client uses:

import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL

Fallback:

http://localhost:5000/api

Optional .env inside client:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
